									<h2>Project 1 Final Statement</h2>

										<p> One of the ideas that I had was to make an A.I generated an image of a man and a robot reaching with their hands to grab one another. 
											It would reference the way that God and Adam were reaching out for each other in The Creation of Adam by Michaelangelo. I did actually make an art piece
											like this during my studio art one class in which I generated an image with Dall-E. The reason that I wanted to do this was because I wanted to highlight the
											imperfections that artificial intelligence is known for. Specifically, hands are notoriously bad at being drawn by artificial intelligence, so focusing on that
											subject matter was important for me and the piece, which is why I decided to reference The Creation of Adam. Another aspect that I really liked about that was how
											man was almost playing God and breathing life into a new species. I've always found the philosophy behind artificial intelligence and consciousness fascinating.
											Things like the Turing Test, self-awareness, etc... are all milestones that artificial consciousness should (and potentially already have) crossed. 
											With this idea specifically, I think I'd like to generate more A.I images, of this man and machine reaching out to one another, to see how much more evolved
											artificial intelligence has come. Dall-E is unfortunately discontinued, but parties other than OpenAI have good generators and I want to still venture into that
											seeing how messed up the fingers can be with artificial intelligence. Below is the image that I made in the studio art one class.</p>
