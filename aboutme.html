									<p> Hello! My name is Max Gong and I'm currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder where 
                                        I'm majoring in Information Science and minoring in Art Practices. My hobbies include playing a variety of recreational games, engaging in casual volleyball, and of course, creating art.
                                        Along with a cat and a younger sister, I was born and raised in the Bay Area, where I started my art journey. I loved doing artwork of the landscape and nature surrounding me and
                                        sketching flowers, buildings, trees, and landmarks was how I got into making artwork. I've since broadened my subjects into doing 
                                        whatever piques my interest. My mediums have also expanded, as I now enjoy working with drawing utensils, both oil and acrylic paints, and digital art software.  
                                        I've always appreciated how artists are able to visualize a design and bring that image into reality. 
                                        Whether it be a sculpture, a painting, or a photo, it was always incredibly fascinating to see the process and the creativity behind
                                        such an ability and I would love to one day be able to perfectly accomplish such a feat. I think my ideal career is to connect my passion for the arts with the growing
                                        industry of technology. Working in some sort of form within the user interface/user experience field or perhaps data visualization and interaction will scratch the itch that
                                        I have designed and optimized experiences while also making them aesthetically pleasing. Hopefully, this class will allow me to take another step in that direction.</p>
